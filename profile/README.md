Your All-in-One Digital Torah App

**TorahApp** is a free, not-for-profit mobile and web application designed for comprehensive Orthodox Jewish Torah study. It serves as a unified platform that integrates a curated library of classical Jewish texts (*seforim*) with an extensive collection of audio and video lectures (*shiurim*).


## Key Features

*   **Orthodox-Curated Library:** Access over 6,000 *seforim* (including Chumash, Talmud, Halacha, etc.) and English translations. All texts are curated under rabbinic guidance (including a formal *haskama* from R' Gil Student, Rabbinical Alliance of America/RAA) to adhere exclusively to Orthodox standards.
*   **1 Million+ *Shiurim* (Lectures):** Integrates one of the world's largest collections of audio and video classes from providers like YUTorah, OU Torah (All Daf), Podcasts, Torahcasts and some of TorahAnytime & Chabad.
*   **Integrated Learning:** Allows dynamic text-audio synchronization and multi-tab viewing, so users can follow along with a *shiur* while reading the original text or commentaries.
*   **Commuter-Optimized:** Features "Binge-Listening" for continuous playback of lecture series and native integration with **Apple CarPlay** and **Android Auto**.
*   **Smart Tools:** Includes a **Smart Siddur** (prayer book) that automatically adjusts the text based on the Jewish calendar, Tikkun Mode for Torah reading practice, Sefirat HaOmer counter, and daily learning calendars (*Daf Yomi*, *Nach Yomi*, *Shnayim Mikra*).
*   **Accessibility:** Supports full **Offline Access** for texts and downloaded lectures.
